# ML-AI-Discord-Bots
Basic templates I made for using either OpenAI or TensorFlow to create ML AI chatbots for Discord servers. Added a template for an image-generating ML AI openAI discord bot.

Added basic logprobs reinforcement functionality to one bot
Uploaded a training dataset of comments web-scraped from reddit that I then cleaned up + formatted.
